## About presentation
**My first paper report and presentaion in group meeting.**
2024.09.07
I always feel nervous, and my mind goes blank easily. I don't know what to say when I turn to the next page of the PPT. Consequently, my presentation is unskilled, full of pauses and hesitations. The same situation happened during my udergraduate thesis defense. From my perspective, there are some multiple underlying reasons for above issues:
- Being not familiar with the PPTs.
- Being too nervous led to a blank mind.
- The innovation points of the paper is litmited.
Some methods to deal with these problems:
- make a **presentation drafts** to remind me:
	- what points I do want to express on this page ppt, in what order should they be arranged, and how do I orgranize my language to deliver it.
	- how much time should I spend on this page ppt.
- **practice no less than 15 times**, and succeed in delivering it well **at least 3 times**.
- exercise my ability to express my point
- grasp the opportunity to deliver a presentation.
