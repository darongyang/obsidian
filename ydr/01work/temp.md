- Inter-page skewness leads to unnecessary overhead. As illustrated in Figure 5a, even pages that never updated (i.e., Cold LP in figure) are encoded with **redundant** WOM-v code (e.g., two PPs allocated to LP permanently in WOM-v(2,4)-SSDs), **leading to unnecessary overhead and thus low efficiency**. mention GC problem (leading to limited lifetime).
- Intra-page skewness leads to under optimized local wear. As illustrated in Figure 5b, the page updates are usually concentrated in a small region of page due to intra-page skewness, **whereas existing WOM-v-based SSDs encode the entire LP to several PPs, leading to unnecessary overhead and thus low efficiency.** **Moreover, the voltage of this region reaches Vmax quickly, and further updates will result in the erasing of the entire page, despite the voltage of the other regions are still underutilized, leading to limited lifetime.** We refer to this as local wear.
