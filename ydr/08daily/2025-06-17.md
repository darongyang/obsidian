## Summary

	- I mainly do some non-work-related chores, such as edit schedule, sync the photos in the morning——an idle morning. 
	- I implement the deltaftl in the afternoon
	- I refactor the vm manager scripts on the host —— a fruitless evening. 
- **Problem and Gains.** ==How can I improve my efficieny on work? Maybe I should  take breaks frequently==
- **Tomorrow Plan**. 
	- fix the deltaftl bug
	- do some test on deltaftl
	- refactor the test scripts
	- perform the test on deltaftl
